# PLC-Files
 
This contains all PLC files for Good Foods.

When updating Files, please use detailed descriptions for your commits. This is required because GitHub can not parse PLC files. THIS MEANS YOUR NOTES ARE THE ONLY THING THAT ALLOW US TO SEE WHAT WAS CHANGED.

Git is able to DETECT simple changes. From single rungs, adding a single data type, to changing a single bit a Latch is looking at.

All BAK** files will be ignored by git, due to the inbuilt revisioning system on Git, the BAK files are not needed.
